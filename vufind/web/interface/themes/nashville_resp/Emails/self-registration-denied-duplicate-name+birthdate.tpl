Welcome Back to the Nashville Public Library!

You recently attempted to register for a Digital Access Card... but you might already have a card with us!

Please visit a branch library https://library.nashville.org/locations

or get account help online https://nashvillepl.libanswers.com/form.php?queue_id=2431

or give us a call at 615-862-5800

and let the Librarian know you tried to get a Digital Access Card but couldn't because your name was already in our system.
